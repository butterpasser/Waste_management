"fnSeqID","Footnote"
"1","Data refer to households only."
"2","The increase of the indicator compared to previous years is determined by significant increase in volumes of  fisheries started from 2011."
"3","Estimated according to Brazilian Water Resources Report methodology (National Water Agency, 2013)"
"4","These totals include wastewater generated by economic activity 57 - Sewerage."
"5","Increased coverage of the population covered by public water treatment from 2015. By 2015, a decrease in the volume of wastewater without treatment is reported. There are two reasons for that: 1. In 2015, there was more information provided by the Ministry of Health due to a larger number of treatment plants operations reports, which had not been taken into account during the 2008-2014 period and, 2. The first phase of the new treatment plant (called 'Los Tajos') was inaugurated in 2015 for the Greater Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica (GAM). Although official data are not available, an estimated 166,000 people are currently being covered by this plant, which would imply a 4% increase in the population covered by wastewater treatment (preliminary data)."
"6","The total volume of wastewater was estimated using a return coefficient of 70% with respect to net water sold to users, which is the one that the technicians of the Costa Rican Institute of Aqueducts and Sewers (A and A) use to estimate the total wastewater generated. In contrast,  the technicians of the Public Services Company of Heredia used a return coefficient of 75%. Limitation: It should be mentioned that this percentage of 70% used for the estimation is in the lower limit of the range considered by specialists for this variable, which is 70% to 90%, and must be reconsidered in light of new and more precise information."
"7","Provisional."
"8","Report of the Environment Statistics for Iraq for the years 2013-2014 Data Source Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works and the Municipality of Baghdad (decrease in the amount of wastewater produced due to the failure of some stations, which led to the transfer of a section of wastewater to the river directly)."
"9","Data include wastewater generated from all the transformation industries including the electricity sector and oil refiners within the environmental survey for the industry sector for 2012. For other data in this time series, wastewater generated from transformation industries (including electricity sector, oil refiners) is excluded."
"10","Report on Environment Statistics for Iraq 2008 / Data Source Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works and the Secretariat of Baghdad, the reason for the decrease in the quantity of wastewater produced due to the interruption of central processing plants because of maintenance work."
"11","Estimate."
"12","Refers to incoming volume at the wastewater treatment plant."
"13","The wastewater comes from households and some manufacturing industries. Both types of wastewater are discharged to the sewer and can not be accounted for by sector."
"14","Wastewater collected in government and semi-government water treatment plants."
